I am a Technical Product Manager at IBM, working on AI product development and cloud-native developer tooling. I enjoy bringing structure to ambiguity and helping teams align on what to build and how to deliver it.

I hold an MSc in Information Systems from the University of Amsterdam and a BSc in Economics from University College Dublin.

My recent work has focused on agentic AI infrastructure, where I've helped build custom MCP servers for async messaging, and data-driven strategies to improve technical adoption. I'm also interested in the practical applications of MQTT for IoT use cases.
