I am a **Technical Product Manager** at **IBM**, working on AI product development and cloud-native developer tools.

### AI Product Management

To me, being an AI PM is about maintaining a rigorous information diet and staying agile. It’s less about abstract curiosity and more about anticipating how weekly advancements might impact the product. My focus is on making quick, informed decisions to mitigate risk and seize opportunities, building at the limit of what is possible.

### What I'm Working On

- **Agentic AI Infrastructure**: Working on async messaging to enable the agentic AI economy.
- **Industrial IoT**: Thinking about how intelligence can affect industrial processes through IIoT.

### Explore

- **[Projects](/portfolio/)**: Check out **El Palabrero**, my AI language learning tool.
